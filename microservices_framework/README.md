# Advanced FastAPI Microservices & Serverless Framework

This framework implements advanced principles for building scalable, maintainable microservices and serverless applications using FastAPI.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
- **Stateless Services**: All services are designed to be stateless with external storage for persistence
- **API Gateway Integration**: Centralized routing, rate limiting, and security
- **Circuit Breakers**: Resilient service communication with automatic failure handling
- **Serverless Optimization**: Optimized for AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and other serverless platforms
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Inter-service communication using message brokers

### Key Components

1. **Microservices Core**
   - Service discovery and registration
   - Circuit breaker patterns
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Health checks and monitoring

2. **API Gateway**
   - Request routing and load balancing
   - Rate limiting and throttling
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Request/response transformation

3. **Serverless Patterns**
   - Cold start optimization
   - Lightweight container packaging
   - Managed service integration
   - Automatic scaling

4. **Advanced Middleware**
   - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
   - Structured logging
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security headers and validation

5. **Caching Strategy**
   - Redis distributed caching
   - Cache invalidation patterns
   - Performance optimization

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the API Gateway
python gateway/main.py

# Start individual services
python services/user_service/main.py
python services/video_service/main.py
```

## 🔧 Configuration

All services use environment-based configuration with validation:

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class ServiceSettings(BaseSettings):
    service_name: str
    port: int = 8000
    database_url: str
    redis_url: str
    api_gateway_url: str
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging

## 🔒 Security

- OAuth2 with JWT tokens
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Security headers (CORS, CSP, HSTS)
- Input validation and sanitization

## 🌐 Serverless Deployment

Optimized for:
- AWS Lambda with Mangum adapter
- Azure Functions
- Google Cloud Functions
- Vercel and Netlify

## 📈 Performance

- Async/await patterns throughout
- Connection pooling
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing
- Auto-scaling
