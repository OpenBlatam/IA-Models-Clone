### Basic Usage
```python
from tests.refactored_test_generator import RefactoredTestGenerator

# Create generator
generator = RefactoredTestGenerator()

# Generate tests
test_cases = generator.generate_tests(your_function, num_tests=20)

# Analyze results
for test_case in test_cases:
    print(f"Name: {test_case.name}")
    print(f"Quality: {test_case.overall_quality:.2f}")
    print(f"Uniqueness: {test_case.uniqueness:.2f}")
    print(f"Diversity: {test_case.diversity:.2f}")
    print(f"Intuition: {test_case.intuition:.2f}")
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Generate specific test types
unique_tests = [tc for tc in test_cases if tc.test_type == "unique"]
diverse_tests = [tc for tc in test_cases if tc.test_type == "diverse"]
intuitive_tests = [tc for tc in test_cases if tc.test_type == "intuitive"]

# Filter by quality
high_quality_tests = [tc for tc in test_cases if tc.overall_quality > 0.8]

# Sort by specific metric
sorted_by_uniqueness = sorted(test_cases, key=lambda x: x.uniqueness, reverse=True)
```
