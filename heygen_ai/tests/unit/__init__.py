Unit Tests Package
==================

Contains unit tests for individual components, organized by clean architecture layers.

Structure:
- domain/: Tests for domain entities, value objects, and domain services
- application/: Tests for use cases and application services  
- infrastructure/: Tests for repositories, external APIs, and infrastructure services
- presentation/: Tests for API endpoints, middleware, and presentation logic

Unit tests are fast, isolated, and focus on testing individual components
without external dependencies.
