    def check_rate_limit(self, request: ScanRequest) -> RateLimitResult:
        """Check if request is allowed under current rate limits."""
        # Guard clauses for early returns
        if self._should_skip_target(request.target):
            return RateLimitResult(allowed=False, reason="target_skipped")
        
        # Token bucket check
        if self.tokens < 1:
            return RateLimitResult(allowed=False, limit_exceeded=True)
        
        # Sliding window rate check
        if current_rate >= self.current_rate:
            return RateLimitResult(allowed=False, limit_exceeded=True)
        
        # Anomaly detection
        anomalies = self._detect_anomalies()
        if anomalies:
            self._adjust_rate(anomalies)
            return RateLimitResult(allowed=False, back_off_required=True)
        
        # Happy path - allow request
        return RateLimitResult(allowed=True)
```

```python
class IntelligentBackOff:
    """Intelligent back-off with multiple strategies."""
    
    def get_delay(self, target: str, error_type: str = None) -> float:
        """Get back-off delay for target."""
        # Guard clause for max attempts
        if self.attempt_counts[target] > self.config.max_attempts:
            return self.config.max_delay
        
        # Calculate base delay based on strategy
        if self.config.strategy == BackOffStrategy.EXPONENTIAL:
            delay = self._calculate_exponential_delay(attempt)
        elif self.config.strategy == BackOffStrategy.ADAPTIVE:
            delay = self._calculate_adaptive_delay(target, error_type)
        # ... other strategies
        
        # Add jitter and return
        return self._add_jitter(delay)
```

```python
class StealthScanner:
    """Stealth network scanner with rate limiting and back-off."""
    
    async def scan_target(self, target: str, scan_type: ScanType, 
                         ports: List[int] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Scan a single target with rate limiting and back-off."""
        # Guard clauses for early returns
        if self._should_skip_target(target, scan_type):
            return {'target': target, 'status': 'skipped'}
        
        # Rate limit check
        rate_result = self.rate_limiter.check_rate_limit(request)
        if not rate_result.allowed:
            delay = self.back_off.get_delay(target, 'rate_limit') if rate_result.back_off_required else rate_result.delay_required
            await asyncio.sleep(delay)
            return {'target': target, 'status': 'rate_limited', 'delay': delay}
        
        # Stealth delay
        stealth_delay = self._calculate_stealth_delay(target, scan_type)
        await asyncio.sleep(stealth_delay)
        
        # Happy path - perform scan
        return await self._perform_scan(target, scan_type, ports)
```
