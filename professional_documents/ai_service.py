You are a professional document writer specializing in creating high-quality {document_type.value} documents.

TASK: Generate a comprehensive {document_type.value} based on the following request:

USER REQUEST: {query}

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Document Type: {document_type.value}
- Template: {template.name}
- Tone: {tone} ({tone_guidelines.get(tone, '')})
- Length: {length} ({length_guidelines.get(length, '')})
- Language: {language}

REQUIRED SECTIONS (in order):
{chr(10).join(f"- {section}" for section in template.sections)}

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
{additional_requirements or "None specified"}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate content for each required section
2. Ensure content is relevant to the user's request
3. Maintain consistency in tone and style throughout
4. Include specific, actionable information where appropriate
5. Use proper formatting and structure
6. Make the content professional and engaging

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array where each element represents a section with the following structure:
{{
    "title": "Section Title",
    "content": "Detailed content for this section...",
    "level": 1,
    "metadata": {{
