## 🏢 **Enterprise Features Showcase**

### **🔒 Multi-Tenant Security:**
```python
# Tenant-isolated processing
request.tenant_id = "enterprise-client-001"
response = await enhanced_service.generate_caption(request)

# Per-tenant rate limiting
await rate_limiter.check_tenant_limit(tenant_id)

# Tenant-specific configurations
config = enhanced_config.get_tenant_config(tenant_id)
```

### **📊 Advanced Monitoring:**
```python
# Comprehensive health checks
health = await enhanced_service.health_check()
# Returns: status, uptime, metrics, enterprise_features

# Real-time metrics
metrics = await enhanced_service.get_enhanced_metrics()
# Returns: performance_specs, service_metrics, capabilities
```

### **🛡️ Circuit Breaker Protection:**
```python
# Automatic failure detection and recovery
if circuit_breaker.can_execute():
    result = await enhanced_service.process_request()
    circuit_breaker.record_success()
else:
    # Service temporarily unavailable, graceful degradation
    return fallback_response()
```

### **⚡ Real-Time Streaming:**
```python
# Server-sent events for live updates
@app.get("/api/v11/stream/generate")
async def stream_caption_generation():
    # Progressive response streaming with live status
    yield "data: {'status': 'processing', 'progress': 30}\n\n"
```
