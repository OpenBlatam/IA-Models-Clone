# TruthGPT Optimization Core â€” OMEGA ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE

## Scope
- Model Orchestration System (workflows, pipelines, services)
- Model Automation System (AutoML, NAS, HPO)
- Model Intelligence System (adaptive learning, self-improvement, autonomous optimization)

## Highlights
- Orchestration Modes: sequential, parallel, conditional, dynamic
- Automation Strategies: Bayesian/TPE HPO, DARTS/ENAS NAS, ensembles
- Intelligence Capabilities: adaptation, self-improvement cycles, constraint-aware optimization

## Key Modules
- `optimization_core/model_orchestration.py`
  - `WorkflowOrchestrator`, `PipelineOrchestrator`, `ServiceOrchestrator`, `ModelOrchestrationSystem`
- `optimization_core/model_automation.py`
  - `AutoMLSystem`, `NeuralArchitectureSearch`, `HyperparameterOptimizer`, `ModelAutomationSystem`
- `optimization_core/model_intelligence.py`
  - `AdaptiveLearningSystem`, `SelfImprovementSystem`, `AutonomousOptimizationSystem`, `ModelIntelligenceSystem`

## Factory + Examples
- Factory creators for all systems are included.
- Self-contained example runners in each module for quick validation and demos.

## Production Readiness
- Resource controls (CPU/MEM/GPU), retries, health checks, circuit breakers (service layer)
- Metrics/report generators for orchestration, automation, and intelligence runs

## Next Suggestions
- Integrate collaboration/distributed learning (peer-to-peer, federated synergy)
- Extend observability dashboards with cross-system run lineage
- Add CLI wrappers for common orchestration and automation scenarios

## Status
All listed systems are implemented and integrated successfully.
