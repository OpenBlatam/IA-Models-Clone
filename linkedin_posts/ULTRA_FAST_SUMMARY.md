## üéØ Performance Recommendations

### For Maximum Speed

1. **Use Batch Operations**
   ```python
   # Instead of individual operations
   for item in items:
       await cache.set(item.key, item.value)
   
   # Use batch operations
   await cache.set_many(batch_data)
   ```

2. **Leverage Async Patterns**
   ```python
   # Instead of sequential execution
   title = await generate_title()
   content = await generate_content()
   hashtags = await generate_hashtags()
   
   # Use concurrent execution
   title, content, hashtags = await asyncio.gather(
       generate_title(), generate_content(), generate_hashtags()
   )
   ```

3. **Optimize Cache Usage**
   ```python
   # Use appropriate TTL
   await cache.set(key, value, ttl=3600)  # 1 hour
   
   # Use compression for large data
   await cache.set(key, large_data, compress=True)
   ```

4. **Monitor Performance**
   ```python
   # Regular performance monitoring
   report = optimizer.get_performance_report()
   if report['cache_hit_rate'] < 80:
       # Optimize cache strategy
   ```
