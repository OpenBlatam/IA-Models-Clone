# Key Principles for Scalable API and AI System Development

1. **Design for Scalability and Performance**
   - Use asynchronous frameworks (e.g., FastAPI, Starlette) and non-blocking I/O.
   - Optimize data pipelines and model inference for batch and parallel processing.
   - Profile and monitor system bottlenecks regularly.

2. **Separation of Concerns and Modularity**
   - Organize code into clear modules: API, models, data, training, evaluation, utils.
   - Use dependency injection and clear interfaces between components.

3. **Configuration and Reproducibility**
   - Store all settings, hyperparameters, and paths in versioned config files (YAML/JSON).
   - Ensure all experiments and deployments are reproducible from config and code.

4. **Experiment Tracking and Model Management**
   - Track all experiments, metrics, and artifacts with tools like wandb, MLflow, or TensorBoard.
   - Save and version model checkpoints and configs.

5. **Robustness, Testing, and Monitoring**
   - Write unit, integration, and performance tests for all critical components.
   - Monitor system health with Prometheus, logs, and alerting.
   - Implement error handling and graceful degradation.

6. **Security and Data Privacy**
   - Never store secrets or credentials in code; use environment variables or secret managers.
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
   - Comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.).

7. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - Use automated pipelines for testing, building, and deploying code.
   - Enforce code quality and security checks on every commit.

8. **Documentation and Collaboration**
   - Document APIs, configs, and system architecture.
   - Use version control (git) for all code, configs, and documentation.
   - Encourage code reviews and collaborative development.
